<p>This section covers the topic of graphs as data <a class="reference external" href="http://structure.In">structure.In</a> mathematics, a graph is a structure consisting of vertices (nodes) and edges (connections) that connect these vertices. In general, graphs share many similarities with trees, and one can consider trees as a special case of graphs. However, the practical value of graphs in solving real-world problems is much greater. Many tasks can be reduced to considering a set of objects whose properties are described by the relationships between them. Such objects include electrical and electronic circuits, circuit boards, road maps, aviation routes, descriptions of constructions, and games. Among the tasks that can be solved using graphs are finding the shortest path between two vertices, solving the problem of maximum capacity of pipelines, road networks, or computer networks, distributing N workers to perform M different types of work, and choosing the most efficient method of problem solving, among others.
More strictly, a graph G is given by a set of vertices {V} and a set of edges {E} connecting all or part of these vertices. Thus, a graph G is completely defined as {V, E}. If edges are oriented, they are called arcs, and a graph with such edges is called an oriented graph (Figure 9.1 a). If the edges have no orientation, the graph is called an undirected graph:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Figure 9.1. The view of a) -undirected;
 - directed</p>
<p>The elements of a graph are called vertices and edges. The number of vertices in the graph is called the order, and the number of edges is called the size of the graph. The endpoints of an edge <em>e = {u,v}</em> are called vertices <em>(u,v)</em>, and two endpoints of the same edge are called adjacent. Two edges are called adjacent if they have a common endpoint. Two edges are called multiples if the sets of their endpoints are the same. An edge is called a loop if its ends coincide, that is, e = {u,u}. If the vertex is the beginning or end of the edge, then they (vertex and edge) are incident. The number of edges incident to a vertex is called the vertex degree (Figure 9.2).</p>

<h2>9.2. Graph representation methods<a class="headerlink" href="#graph-representation-methods" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Solving problems related to the processing of a data set organized in the form of graphs requires their modelling in computer programs. In principle, a set of vertices can be stored in an array and accessed by index. You can also store vertices using a simple-linked list or other data structure. In practice, two structures are typically used to model the structure of a graph: the adjacency matrix and the adjacency list. Adjacent in the sense that such vertices are connected by one edge.
Adjacency matrix is a two-dimensional array that indicates the existence of a relationship between two vertices. If the graph has <em>V</em> vertices, then the adjacency matrix is a <em>V × V array</em>. Figure 9.3 shows undirected and directed graphs with adjacency matrices, where (1) denotes the presence of an adjacent relationship between vertices. For instance, in an undirected graph, vertex (2) is adjacent to vertices (1), (3), (4), and (5), while in a directed graph, vertex (2) is adjacent to vertices (1), (3), and (4).</p>

</div>
<p style="text-align: center;">Figure 9.3. Graph representation in the adjacency matrix</p>
<p>The representation of a graph in the adjacency matrix is problematic. Foremost, when constructing a matrix, it is necessary to know in advance the number of vertices in the graph, which leads to the need to build a new matrix each time new vertices are inserted. In addition, the adjacency matrix consists mainly of zeros, resulting in inefficient memory usage, and if the graph contains V vertices, then memory for V^2 elements must be allocated 1.
In some cases, a more efficient way to represent a graph is to use an adjacency list. More precisely, we are talking about arrays of Linked  lists, where each individual list contains information about which vertices are adjacent to a given one. Undirected and directed graphs and their adjacency lists are depicted in Figure 9.4.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">

</div>
<p style="text-align: center;">Figure 9.4. Graph representation in a adjacency list</p>
<p>The matrix and adjacency list for an undirected graph differ from a directed graph in that the ‘1’ labels n the matrix are applied to all adjacent vertices (Fig. 9.4.). In most practical cases, graph processing problems contain values that are associated with either the vertices of the graph or its edges. For example, in the problem of finding the optimal path between two points, the edges of the graph need to be loaded with such data as the distance between these vertices and the cost of travel per 1 km (Fig. 9.5):</p>

<h2>9.3. Graph interface and algorithms<a class="headerlink" href="#graph-interface-and-algorithms" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>The interface of a graph as a data structure is a set of methods that define the basic operations available for working with a graph. This interface includes methods for getting the number of vertices and edges in a graph, accessing a specific edge between vertices, adding and removing vertices and edges, and methods for working with iterators to get information about incoming and outgoing edges for a particular vertex. The graph interface allows you to work with graph data structures and implement them in accordance with the requirements of a specific task.
In the Golang programming language, a graph interface can be implemented using structures and methods, the content of which is determined by a specific task and the choice of basic data structures from which new types will be created. In the simplest case, working with graphs requires the inclusion of fields in the graph structure to display vertices and/or edges. To create  a Graph type With support for representing a graph using a list of contiguities, various basic structures of the Golang language are used (slices whose elements are Linked Lists, maps, two-dimensional slices [] []).
Let’s look at some examples of the construction of a directed graph as shown in Fig. 9.6. using the basic structures mentioned above (Table 9.1.).</p>

</div>
<p style="text-align: center;">Figure 9.5. Directed graph for interface illustration</p>
<p>When choosing how to implement the graph interface using the Golang language, you should be guided by the following criteria:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Linked List:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>it is used when you want to store relationships between vertices in a graph as an adjacency list;</p></li>
<li><p>suitable for implementing graphs with a large number of edges and a small number of vertices;</p></li>
<li><p>allows you to efficiently add and remove edges between vertices.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Map:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>it is used when you want to store relationships between vertices of a graph in the form of a dictionary, where the keys are vertices and the values are their neighbors;</p></li>
<li><p>suitable for implementing graphs with an arbitrary number of vertices and edges;</p></li>
<li><p>allows you to quickly get a list of neighbors for a given vertex.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Slice:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>it is used when you want to store relationships between vertices in a graph as slices, where the slice indexes correspond to vertices and the values are their neighbors;</p></li>
<li><p>suitable for implementing graphs with a fixed number of vertices;</p></li>
<li><p>allows you to efficiently get a list of neighbors for a given vertex.
The specific implementation method depends on the specific requirements for the graph, such as the number of vertices and edges, the operations that will be performed most often (adding vertices, adding edges, finding neighbors, and so on), and the specifics of the problem in which the graph will be used.</p></li>

<h2>9.4. Basic graph algorithms<a class="headerlink" href="#basic-graph-algorithms" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Due to the widespread use of graphs, there are a large number of algorithms for processing them. Among the problems solved within the framework of graph theory are:
•	Definition of the graph and its properties;
•	Actions with graphs;
•	Routes, chains and cycles, contours;
•	Calculation of graph characteristics;
Let’s have a look at the main algorithms used for these tasks, implemented, as before, within the framework of DRAKON + Golang hybrid programming. Once the graph has been constructed and its properties have been checked, the problem of traversing the graph through its vertices can naturally arise. The general task is formulated as follows: to traverse the graph, starting from a given vertex and moving along the edges to other vertices, in order to visit all vertices.
There are two main ways of traversing graphs: depth-first  traversal (dfs) and breadth traversal (bfs), which ensure that all connected vertices are traversed. The difference between depth-first and breadth-first search is that the result of a depth-first search algorithm is a route that can sequentially traverse all the vertices of the graph that are accessible from the initial vertex. This is fundamentally different from breadth-first search, which traverses all the vertices of one level first, and then traverses the vertices of the next levels sequentially.</p>

<h3>9.4.1. Depth-first  traversal (DFS)<a class="headerlink" href="#depth-first-traversal-dfs" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Consider the main algorithms used in these problems and implemented, as before, within the framework of hybrid programming DRAKON+Golang.</p>
<p>After a graph is constructed and its properties tested, it is natural to
traverse its vertices. The general problem is formulated as follows: to
circumvent the graph, starting at a given vertex and moving along the
edges to other vertices, visit all vertices connected to the original.
There are two main ways to circumvent graphs: depth traversal and width
traversal, which provide a brute-force of all connected vertices.</p>
<p>The difference between depth search and width search is that (in the
case of an undirected graph), the result of a depth-first search
algorithm is some route by which it is possible to circumvent
sequentially all vertices of the graph available from the initial
vertex. This is fundamentally different from a breadth search, where
multiple vertices are simultaneously processed, and only one vertex is
processed in depth at each time. On the other hand, depth-first searches
do not find the shortest paths, but they do apply to situations where
the graph is unknown in its entirety and is investigated by some
automated device.</p>

<h4>9.4.1.2. The breadth-first search algorithm<a class="headerlink" href="#the-breadth-first-search-algorithm" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h4>
<p>The depth-first traversal of the graph is justified in situations where it is necessary to investigate the unknown structure of a real object represented as a graph. If the graph is oriented, the depth search builds a tree of paths from the starting vertex to all the tops accessible from it. The algorithm for traversing the graph in depth can be represented as follows. Suppose an observer in one of the vertices of a graph is given the task of traversing all its vertices. While at this vertex, the observer sees the edges emanating from that vertex. In the case of a sufficiently complex graph structure, the observer runs the risk of passing through some vertices several times and, in the end, getting stuck in a loop. To avoid such a situation, the observer should mark all the visited vertices and should not go to the peak that he has already visited. Then the algorithm might look like this:</p>
<p>•	Select the vertex from which the graph traversal begins;
•	Go to any adjacent vertex that has not been visited before;
•	Run the depth-first traversal algorithm from this vertex;
•	Return to the starting vertex; Repeat the process for all previously unvisited adjacent vertice</p>
<p>Thus, in order to implement the algorithm, you will need to note which vertices the researcher was in and which were not. The mark will be made in the slice  visit, where <em>visit[i] == True</em> for visited vertices, and <em>visit[i] == false</em> for unvisited vertices. The mark “about visiting a vertice” is put when entering this vertex.</p>
<p>A depth-first search starts by visiting the original vertex start, and then recursively visits all adjacent vertices. The visit to the vertex is recorded in the logical slice visit. The depth-first traversal algorithm is based on a recursive function that retrieves a vertex from the stack and checks it for attendance. If the vertex has already been visited, the traversal continues to search the adjacency list until it reaches the dead-end vertex. An illustration of a graph traversal in depth is presented Fig.9.12.</p>

</div>
<p style="text-align: center;">Figure 9.12. Illustration of depth-first traversal of a directed graph</p>
<p>The depth-traversal algorithm for undirected and directed graphs is broadly similar, but its execution may vary due to differences in the directionality of the edges and arrows in the graph. This difference lies in the fact that in undirected graphs it is possible to relate vertices in both directions without explicitly taking into account the direction. In directed graphs, each edge is counted only once in the direction from the start vertex to the end vertex. The dragon diagram of the algorithm for traversing the graph in depth is shown in Fig. 9.13.</p>

<p>Graph breadth-first traversal is widely used in a variety of fields, such as computer networks, web search, image processing, and other areas that require analysis of the data structure represented as a graph. A breadth-first traversal visits all vertices that are on the same level, and then moves on to the next level, and so on. Recall that a graph level is a group of vertices that are at the same distance from the initial vertex. As an example, consider the algorithm for traversing a graph in the width of an undirected graph (Fig. 9.14),</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">

</div>
<p style="text-align: center;">Figure 9.14. Undirected graph and Its adjacency list</p>
<p>In this case, unlike the previous depth-first traversal algorithm, to traverse the graph in width, we create an empty map [int] bool to track the visited vertices and an empty queue [] slice to add the visited vertices (Figure 9.15).</p>

<p>In the first step of the algorithm, the start vertex is added to the queue. At each width traversal step, a vertex is retrieved from the top of the queue. If this vertex has already been visited (is in the visited state), the program moves on to the next iteration of the loop, interrupting the current iteration. If the summit has not yet been visited, it is displayed and marked as visited. Then, each neighbor of that vertex that has not yet been visited is added to the queue Then the traversal continues until the queue is empty. If the queue is empty, the algorithm ends.

<h2>9.5. Choosing a path between vertices in a directed graph<a class="headerlink" href="#choosing-a-path-between-vertices-in-a-directed-graph" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>The choice of a path between two vertices in a directed graph, which is of practical importance in the sense of finding the optimal path between two settlements connected by one-way roads, can be carried out according to various criteria. Let’s set the task as follows: in order to determine the optimal path, find the distances of all possible paths between two geographical points, as well as the total cost of travel, taking into account the different costs per 1 km on different sections of the road.
To solve this problem, it is necessary to create a weighted graph, more specifically, to load the edges between all vertices with the values of the distances between the points and the fare per 1 kilometre (Figure 9.20).</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Figure 9.21.  Drakon-diagrams of methods a). newGaph, b). addEdge, c).allPaths </p>
<p>The algorithm for finding all possible paths between two vertices is based on the sequential analysis of the list of vertex connections and recursive access to the findPath module, which implements a traversal of nodes with fixing a visit to each vertex. The DRAKON-diagram for the findPath module is shown in Figure 9.21. The algorithm consists of three parts: in the first part, the correctness of the module parameters (the names of the initial and final vertices) is set, and the fact of visiting the current vertex is checked. The second part traverses through the nodes of the graph that have not yet been visited, forming a string consisting of visited vertex names and a separator between them, for example, <em>“2-0-1-4-3-5”</em> (Fig. 9.22). In the third part, when the final vertex is reached, that is, when the condition <em>“start == last”</em> is met, the minimum path between these vertices is determined. In addition, a possible path string, for example, <em>“2-0-1-4-3-5”</em>, is divided into sections of the type <em>“2-0”</em> in order to form keys for maps containing the distances between the corresponding vertices and the cost of travelling 1 km, these areas.</p>

<h2>9.6. Dijkstra’s algorithm – a method for finding the shortest path<a class="headerlink" href="#dijkstra-s-algorithm-a-method-for-finding-the-shortest-path" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>The Dijkstra algorithm is designed to find the shortest paths from a given vertex to all other vertices, provided that the edges of the &lt;pgraph are not negative. The algorithm was named after the Dutch scientist E. W. Dijkstra in 1956. This algorithm is widely used in various fields of science, technology and social life. In GPS systems, an algorithm is used to find the fastest route to a destination. In telecommunications networks, it is used to determine the optimal path for data to be transmitted from source to receiver. In robotics, an algorithm can be used to plan a robot’s path to reach a goal in the most efficient way. In computer games, to determine the path of characters or objects. In network planning, an algorithm can be used to find the optimal delivery path for goods.
To implement Dijkstra’s algorithm, vertex structures of type Vertex  are created to describe vertices  and Graph to describe the graph (Fig. 9.25)</p>

<p>Here, <em>key</em> is the key of the vertex of the graph; <em>adjacent</em> – adjacency list for the vertex; <em>lengths</em>  - a set of edge lengths to vertices from the adjacency list;  <em>dist</em> is the total length of the path.
Next, an instance of the graph is created in the main program and vertices are instantiated in the loop (Fig. 9.26):</p>

    <p style="text-align: center;"c). populating the vertex with data</p>
<p>After creating the vertices of the graph and populating them with data (keys, neighboring vertices, and distances), edges are formed using the addEdge  method (Figure 9.27):</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Figure 9.27. Дракон-диаграммы метода формирования ребер графа addEdge</p>
<p>The algorithm  of the <em>addEdge(from, to, length)</em>  method is implemented as follows. First, the method gets two vertices, between which you need to add an edge (<em>graph.getVertex(from)</em>, <em>graph.getVertex(to)</em>), where <em>from</em> and <em>to</em> are vertex keys. The method then adds the <em>toVertex</em>  vertex to the list of adjacent vertices for the vertex <em>fromVertex</em> (<em>append(fromVertex.adjacent, toVertex)</em>). As a result, an edge is formed between these two vertices <em>fromVertex</em> and <em>toVertex</em>. In the last step, the method adds the edge length to the list of edge lengths for the vertex <em>fromVertex</em> (<em>append(fromVertex.lengths, length)</em>). This means that the length of the edge between the vertices <em>fromVertex</em> and <em>toVertex</em> is now known.</p>
<p>Note that the main program uses the <em>addSymEdge (u,v,L)</em> method, which creates symmetric data for each edge in the undirected graph (Figure 9.28):</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Figure 9.28. Drakon-diagram of the addSymEdge edge symmetrization method</p>
<p>Next, we call the Dijkstra method (startKey int), where startKey int is the initial vertex, and output the final results (Fig. 9.29):</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Figure 9.30  Drakon-diagram of method Dijkstra </p>
<p>Let’s take a look at the basic steps of implementing this algorithm. First, initialization (<em>startVertex := graph.getVertex(startKey</em>); <em>startVertex.dist = 0</em>) takes place, which results  in getting the initial vertex from the key and setting its distance to 0. In the second step, a list of unvisited vertices is created, which is then copied with the <em>copy</em> command in order to be able to manipulate this list during the processing of vertex data without changing the graph itself.</p>
<p>Next, a loop for <em>len(unvisited) != 0</em>  is performed to traverse all unvisited vertices in order to find the vertex with the shortest distance using the method <em>smallest := findSmallest(unvisited)</em> (Fig.  9. 31.)</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">

</div>
<p style="text-align: center;">Figure. 9.31. Drakon-diagram of mrthod findSmallest(unvisited)</p>
<p>The current vertex is then removed from the list of unvisited vertices (<em>unvisited = remove(unvisited, smallest)</em>). Finally, in a loop across all vertices, the distances to adjacent vertices are updated as a result of the shorter path being detected.</p>
<p>As an example, consider the application of Dijkstra’s algorithm to finding the shortest paths from a given vertex for the undirected graph shown in Fig. 9.32.</p>

Distance from start to 2 is 40.20 km
Distance from start to 3 is 70.00 km

<p>And, finally, about estimating the complexity of Dijkstra’s algorithm. This estimate can vary depending on the data structure used to represent the graph. In the case of a <em>Linked List</em>, the time complexity of Dijkstra’s algorithm is estimated to be O(V^2), where V is the number of vertices in the graph. This is because you have to look at all vertices each time you retrieve a minimal item from the priority queue.
When using  the <em>map</em> data structure,  the time complexity of Dijkstra’s algorithm is O((V+E) log V), where E is the number of edges in the graph. This is because it takes O(log V) time to retrieve the minimum element from the priority queue implemented with map.
In both cases, the spatial complexity will be O(V + E) because you need to store all the vertices and edges of the graph. However, it’s worth noting that a map usually takes up more space than a linked list because of the additional information it stores (keys and values).</p>
